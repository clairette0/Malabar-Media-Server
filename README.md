## What is Malabar Media Server

Malabar Media Server is an open-source offline media server built for travel, remote work, classrooms, camping, and more. It runs entirely on an ESP32-S3 dev board, creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot, and serves media through a browser-accessible interface. It does not require internet access and works similarly to in-flight entertainment systems. It also allows multiple users watching seperate media streams at the same time. 

This project is designed to be compact, simple, and easily modifiable. It includes optional 3D-printable hardware and a fully open source firmware and web interface.

---

## Project Inspiration
This project was inspired by my experience running a Jellyfin server at home. I love having full control over my media library, and Jellyfin gave me everything I wanted > streaming movies, shows, books, and music, all from my own hardware. Naturally, I started looking for ways to take that experience on the go.

My first thought was to build a portable server, but I quickly ran into some major hurdles:

- Power-hungry hardware — Even low-power x86 boxes needed a hefty battery setup to stay running for long trips.

- High cost — SBCs like the Raspberry Pi 4, plus power banks, USB storage, and screen interfaces added up quickly.

- Heat and reliability — Trying to cram a full stack of services into a compact case often led to thermal issues and instability when running software meant for server hardware.

That’s when I pivoted.

Instead of replicating a full home media server, I focused on delivering the core experience:

- Offline access

- Local Wi-Fi hotspot

- Simple media browsing and playback

- Support for multiple users

The ESP32-S3 offered just enough performance to handle all of that - with a fraction of the power draw and cost.
The result is Malabar Media Server: a minimalist, reliable, and low-cost media server that delivers the essential features of a home streaming setup in a smaller than pocket sized format.

Is it fancy? No.
Does it work? Absolutely.
And it’s open-source, so anyone can expand, improve, and adapt it for their own needs.

- Serves HTML media interface to any connected device  
- Streams content directly from a FAT32-formatted microSD card  
- Supports simultaneous connections (tested with up to 4 video streams)  
- No app or internet connection required  
- Open source firmware and UI  
- Customizable web interface / Features

## Quick Start

1. Flash the ESP32-S3 with the firmware in the `/firmware/` directory.
2. Format your SD card as **FAT32** and copy the web files from `/SD_Card_Template/`.
3. Place your media files into the appropriate folders (see structure below).
4. Run `media.py` to generate `media.json` automatically.
5. Insert the SD card and power the device.
6. Connect to the Wi-Fi network named `Malabar_Media_Server`.
7. Your browser will be redirected to the offline media interface.

## Future Plans

These are features I'd like to explore in future updates. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the repo or open a pull request!


### Offline Maps with GPS Support
Inspired by [Backcountry Beacon](https://www.instructables.com/USB-Powered-Offline-Map-Server/), the goal is to serve cached map tiles and display the live GPS position from the user's phone or connected device — entirely offline.

### HTML5 Games
Similar to [Gams Offline](https://github.com/Gams-Offline/Gams), I would like to embed simple HTML5 games that work in-browser. The selection in Gams is amazing and make me think of cool math games, would be neat to have even though most require a keyboard.

### Audiobook-Friendly Mode
Improve playback for long-form audio by adding bookmarks, chapter display, and smart pause/resume. Intended for better audiobook handling in the Music section. Potentialy add an entire new audiobook section or a seperate handling system for it in books (Under read it could have a listen option).
